Current Plans:

1. Fix Current State CouchBot - The code in this repository is the rewritten code.
2. Package CouchBot Rewrite into an installer.
3. Run him on his current server, free and available to all.
4. Also make him available, free of charge, to those that want to run their own version of him on their own servers, computers, etc.

Free Bots for All! :D
