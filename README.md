# Welcome to the Couch!

Looking to engage your communities, let your Mixer, Twitch, and YouTube viewers know when you've got new content, or know when your favorite creators have gone live? Look no further. CouchBot has been running for over 3 years, has gone through a few rewrites, and we're one of the best at doing what we do.

CouchBot is monetized to ensure people that use the bot are willing to invest in its day to day, its growth, and its future.
