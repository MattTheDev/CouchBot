These things can get super stuffy and formal - and while I should probably provide something long and drawn out ... I want to make sure the main bullet points are hit.

1. The bot is a premium bot, requiring payment for use.
2. On non-payment, the bot will be removed from a server a week after non-payment. All configuration and data will be removed when the bot is removed. 
3. Money Back Guaruntee - Unhappy with your service? I'm happy to refund the current months services without question. 
4. The bot can be removed from servers when the service is abused. Refunds will not be provided.
5. I, Matt Smith / CouchBot, am not responsible for the content delivered by CouchBot. If you have any concerns, please reach out to me at the email above.

If you have any questions, comments, or feedback - don't hesitate to reach out.
